This workshop will provide a basic introduction to R (an open-source statistical package) along with TM (a plugin for R to assist with text-mining). We will cover importing data into R, simple data manipulation and analysis with TM.

If possible, attendees should [download R](https://cran.rstudio.com/) prior to the session.

You can download the accompanying data from [the GitHub repoistory](https://github.com/clarkdatalabs/textmining).
