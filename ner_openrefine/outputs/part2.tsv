The	O

Primitive	O
Accumulation	O
We	O
have	O
seen	O
how	O
money	O
is	O
changed	O
into	O
capital	O
;	O
how	O
through	O
capital	O
surplus	O
value	O
is	O
made	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
surplus	O
value	O
more	O
capital	O

But	O
the	O
accumulation	O
of	O
capital	O
presupposes	O
surplus	O
value	O
;	O
surplus	O
value	O
presupposes	O
capitalistic	O
production	O
;	O
capitalistic	O
production	O
presupposes	O
the	O
pre-existence	O
of	O
considerable	O
masses	O
of	O
capital	O
and	O
of	O

The	O
legend	O
of	O

tells	O
us	O
certainly	O
how	O
man	O
came	O
to	O

condemned	O
to	O
eat	O
his	O

in	O

but	O
the	O
history	O
