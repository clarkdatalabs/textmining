Our	O
investigation	O
must	O
therefore	O
begin	O
with	O
the	O
analysis	O
of	O
a	O
commodity	O
.	O

A	O
commodity	O
is	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
,	O
an	O
object	O
outside	O
us	O
,	O
a	O
thing	O
that	O
by	O
its	O
properties	O
satisfies	O
human	O
wants	O
of	O
some	O
sort	O
or	O
another	O
.	O

The	O
nature	O
of	O
such	O
wants	O
,	O
whether	O
,	O
for	O
instance	O
,	O
they	O
spring	O
from	O
the	O
stomach	O
or	O
from	O
fancy	O
,	O
makes	O
no	O
difference	O
.	O

Neither	O
are	O
we	O
here	O
concerned	O
to	O
know	O
how	O
the	O
object	O
satisfies	O
these	O
wants	O
,	O
whether	O
directly	O
as	O
means	O
of	O
subsistence	O
,	O
or	O
indirectly	O
as	O
means	O
of	O
production	O
.	O

Every	O
useful	O
thing	O
,	O
as	O
iron	O
,	O
paper	O
,	O
&	O
c.	O
,	O
may	O
be	O
looked	O
at	O
from	O
the	O
two	O
points	O
of	O
view	O
of	O
quality	O
and	O
quantity	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
an	O
assemblage	O
of	O
many	O
properties	O
,	O
and	O
may	O
therefore	O
be	O
of	O
use	O
in	O
various	O
ways	O
.	O

To	O
discover	O
the	O
various	O
uses	O
of	O
things	O
is	O
the	O
work	O
of	O
history	O
.	O

So	O
also	O
is	O
the	O
establishment	O
of	O
socially-recognized	O
standards	O
of	O
measure	O
for	O
the	O
quantities	O
of	O
these	O
useful	O
objects	O
.	O

The	O
diversity	O
of	O
these	O
measures	O
has	O
its	O
origin	O
partly	O
in	O
the	O
diverse	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
objects	O
to	O
be	O
measured	O
,	O
partly	O
in	O
convention	O
.	O

The	O
utility	O
of	O
a	O
thing	O
makes	O
it	O
a	O
use	O
value	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
utility	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
thing	O
of	O
air	O
.	O

Being	O
limited	O
by	O
the	O
physical	O
properties	O
of	O
the	O
commodity	O
,	O
it	O
has	O
no	O
existence	O
apart	O
from	O
that	O
commodity	O
.	O

A	O
commodity	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
iron	O
,	O
corn	O
,	O
or	O
a	O
diamond	O
,	O
is	O
therefore	O
,	O
so	O
far	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
material	O
thing	O
,	O
a	O
use	O
value	O
,	O
something	O
useful	O
.	O

This	O
property	O
of	O
a	O
commodity	O
is	O
independent	O
of	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
labour	O
required	O
to	O
appropriate	O
its	O
useful	O
qualities	O
.	O

When	O
treating	O
of	O
use	O
value	O
,	O
we	O
always	O
assume	O
to	O
be	O
dealing	O
with	O
definite	O
quantities	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
dozens	O
of	O
watches	O
,	O
yards	O
of	O
linen	O
,	O
or	O
tons	O
of	O
iron	O
.	O

The	O
use	O
values	O
of	O
commodities	O
furnish	O
the	O
material	O
for	O
a	O
special	O
study	O
,	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
commercial	O
knowledge	O
of	O
commodities	O
.	O

Use	O
values	O
become	O
a	O
reality	O
only	O
by	O
use	O
or	O
consumption	O
:	O
they	O
also	O
constitute	O
the	O
substance	O
of	O
all	O
wealth	O
,	O
whatever	O
may	O
be	O
the	O
social	O
form	O
of	O
that	O
wealth	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
society	O
we	O
are	O
about	O
to	O
consider	O
,	O
they	O
are	O
,	O
in	O
addition	O
,	O
the	O
material	O
depositories	O
of	O
exchange	O
value	O
.	O

Exchange	O
value	O
,	O
at	O
first	O
sight	O
,	O
presents	O
itself	O
as	O
a	O
quantitative	O
relation	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
proportion	O
in	O
which	O
values	O
in	O
use	O
of	O
one	O
sort	O
are	O
exchanged	O
for	O
those	O
of	O
another	O
sort	O
,	O
a	O
relation	O
constantly	O
changing	O
with	O
time	O
and	O
place	O
.	O

Hence	O
exchange	O
value	O
appears	O
to	O
be	O
something	O
accidental	O
and	O
purely	O
relative	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
an	O
intrinsic	O
value	O
,	O
i.e.	O
,	O
an	O
exchange	O
value	O
that	O
is	O
inseparably	O
connected	O
with	O
,	O
inherent	O
in	O
commodities	O
,	O
seems	O
a	O
contradiction	O
in	O
terms	O
.	O

Let	O
us	O
consider	O
the	O
matter	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
closely	O
.	O

A	O
given	O
commodity	O
,	O
e.g.	O
,	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
wheat	O
is	O
exchanged	O
for	O
x	O
blacking	O
,	O
y	O
silk	O
,	O
or	O
z	O
gold	O
,	O
&	O
c.	O
-	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
for	O
other	O
commodities	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
different	O
proportions	O
.	O

Instead	O
of	O
one	O
exchange	O
value	O
,	O
the	O
wheat	O
has	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
.	O

But	O
since	O
x	O
blacking	O
,	O
y	O
silk	O
,	O
or	O
z	O
gold	O
&	O
c.	O
,	O
each	O
represents	O
the	O
exchange	O
value	O
of	O
one	O
quarter	O
of	O
wheat	O
,	O
x	O
blacking	O
,	O
y	O
silk	O
,	O
z	O
gold	O
,	O
&	O
c.	O
,	O
must	O
,	O
as	O
exchange	O
values	O
,	O
be	O
replaceable	O
by	O
each	O
other	O
,	O
or	O
equal	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
first	O
:	O
the	O
valid	O
exchange	O
values	O
of	O
a	O
given	O
commodity	O
express	O
something	O
equal	O
;	O
secondly	O
,	O
exchange	O
value	O
,	O
generally	O
,	O
is	O
only	O
the	O
mode	O
of	O
expression	O
,	O
the	O
phenomenal	O
form	O
,	O
of	O
something	O
contained	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
yet	O
distinguishable	O
from	O
it	O
.	O

Let	O
us	O
take	O
two	O
commodities	O
,	O
e.g.	O
,	O
corn	O
and	O
iron	O
.	O

The	O
proportions	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
exchangeable	O
,	O
whatever	O
those	O
proportions	O
may	O
be	O
,	O
can	O
always	O
be	O
represented	O
by	O
an	O
equation	O
in	O
which	O
a	O
given	O
quantity	O
of	O
corn	O
is	O
equated	O
to	O
some	O
quantity	O
of	O
iron	O
:	O
e.g.	O
,	O
1	O
quarter	O
corn	O
=	O
x	O
cwt	O
.	O

iron	O
.	O

What	O
does	O
this	O
equation	O
tell	O
us	O
?	O

It	O
tells	O
us	O
that	O
in	O
two	O
different	O
things	O
-	O
in	O
1	O
quarter	O
of	O
corn	O
and	O
x	O
cwt	O
.	O

of	O
iron	O
,	O
there	O
exists	O
in	O
equal	O
quantities	O
something	O
common	O
to	O
both	O
.	O

The	O
two	O
things	O
must	O
therefore	O
be	O
equal	O
to	O
a	O
third	O
,	O
which	O
in	O
itself	O
is	O
neither	O
the	O
one	O
nor	O
the	O
other	O
.	O

Each	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
so	O
far	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
exchange	O
value	O
,	O
must	O
therefore	O
be	O
reducible	O
to	O
this	O
third	O
.	O

A	O
simple	O
geometrical	O
illustration	O
will	O
make	O
this	O
clear	O
.	O

In	O
order	O
to	O
calculate	O
and	O
compare	O
the	O
areas	O
of	O
rectilinear	O
figures	O
,	O
we	O
decompose	O
them	O
into	O
triangles	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
area	O
of	O
the	O
triangle	O
itself	O
is	O
expressed	O
by	O
something	O
totally	O
different	O
from	O
its	O
visible	O
figure	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
by	O
half	O
the	O
product	O
of	O
the	O
base	O
multiplied	O
by	O
the	O
altitude	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
same	O
way	O
the	O
exchange	O
values	O
of	O
commodities	O
must	O
be	O
capable	O
of	O
being	O
expressed	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
something	O
common	O
to	O
them	O
all	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
thing	O
they	O
represent	O
a	O
greater	O
or	O
less	O
quantity	O
.	O

This	O
common	O
``	O
something	O
''	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
either	O
a	O
geometrical	O
,	O
a	O
chemical	O
,	O
or	O
any	O
other	O
natural	O
property	O
of	O
commodities	O

Such	O
properties	O
claim	O
our	O
attention	O
only	O
in	O
so	O
far	O
as	O
they	O
affect	O
the	O
utility	O
of	O
those	O
commodities	O
,	O
make	O
them	O
use	O
values	O

But	O
the	O
exchange	O
of	O
commodities	O
is	O
evidently	O
an	O
act	O
characterised	O
by	O
a	O
total	O
abstraction	O
from	O
use	O
value	O
.	O

Then	O
one	O
use	O
value	O
is	O
just	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
another	O

provided	O
only	O
it	O

as	O

Barbon	PERSON

``	O

consequently	O
do	O
not	O
contain	O
an	O

If	O
then	O
we	O
leave	O
out	O

the	O

Just	O
as	O
the	O
coat	O
in	O
its	O

appear	O
as	O
the	O
direct	O

Hence	O
,	O
the	O
second	O
peculiarity	O
of	O
the	O

form	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
concrete	O

becomes	O
the	O
form	O
under	O
which	O
its	O

itself	O

But	O
because	O
this	O
concrete	O
labour	O
,	O
tailoring	O
in	O
our	O
case	O
,	O
ranks	O
as	O
,	O
and	O
is	O
directly	O
identified	O
with	O
,	O
undifferentiated	O
human	O
labour	O
,	O
it	O
also	O
ranks	O
as	O
identical	O
with	O
any	O
other	O
sort	O
of	O
labour	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
with	O
that	O
embodied	O
in	O
the	O
linen	O
.	O

Consequently	O
,	O
although	O
,	O
like	O
all	O
other	O
commodity-producing	O
labour	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
labour	O
of	O
private	O
individuals	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
it	O
ranks	O
as	O
labour	O
directly	O
social	O
in	O
its	O
character	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
it	O
results	O
in	O
a	O
product	O
directly	O
exchangeable	O
with	O
other	O
commodities	O
.	O

We	O
have	O
then	O
a	O
third	O
peculiarity	O
of	O
the	O
equivalent	O
form	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
labour	O
of	O
private	O

the	O
form	O
of	O
its	O
opposite	O

in	O

form	O

The	O
two	O
latter	O
peculiarities	O
of	O
the	O
equivalent	O
form	O
will	O
become	O
more	O
intelligible	O
if	O
we	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
the	O

was	O
the	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
the	O
products	O

to	O

What	O
chiefly	O
distinguishes	O
a	O

is	O
the	O
fact	O

that	O
it	O
looks	O
upon	O
every	O

as	O

the	O

of	O

A	O

more	O

The	O

makes	O
up	O
for	O
this	O
lack	O
in	O
the	O
commodity	O
of	O
a	O
sense	O

Otherwise	O

Therefore	O

up	O

this	O
change	O

is	O
what	O

with	O

All	O
